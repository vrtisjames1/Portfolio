Nov 1: Created navigation plane. Realized it wouldn't be visually appealing with side navigation plane, so I changed it to a drop down menu from the header. Had difficulty in aligning it with the existing header.

Nov 2: Working on creating the model popup. Not sure if there is a method to pull from a central html element for the model design rather than customizing it on every page. Something to look into when I have spare time with the project.

struggled with the model when adjusting the background transparency. I realized that only the background-color property needed to be transparent.

I realized I had trouble creating a media query for the model model. Still useable but needed to change the close button to the left hand side.
